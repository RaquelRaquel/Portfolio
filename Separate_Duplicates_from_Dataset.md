# Separate Duplicates from Dataset



<br>The goal is to help is to separate any duplicates that we find in the dataset.  This allows us to not count a certain app more than once. When we separate the duplicates, we want to keep the record with the highest number of reviews as that will be the most recent information.


<br> 
The information for this exercise comes from the following datasets.
<br> 
>* 1) a __[data set](https://www.kaggle.com/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps/downloads/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps.zip/7)__  containing data about approximately 7,000 iOS apps from the App Store that was collected in July 20171).
>* 2) a __[data set](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps/downloads/google-play-store-apps.zip/6)__ containing data about approximately 10,000 Android apps from Google Play that was collected in August 2018.
<br>
<br>

The code below opens, reads, and list data for both files, Google Play and App Store.  


```python
# The ios apps file from Apple Store.
open_file_ios = open("AppleStore.csv")
from csv import reader
read_file_ios = reader(open_file_ios)
app_data_ios = list(read_file_ios)
ios_header = app_data_ios[0]
ios_data = app_data_ios[1:]



#The android apps file from Google Play store.
open_file_android = open("googleplaystore.csv")
from csv import reader
read_file_android = reader(open_file_android)
app_data_android = list(read_file_android)
android_header = app_data_android[0]
android_data = app_data_android[1:]
```

In order to explore the dataset, we create a function called `explore_data()`.  The first parameter, `dataset` is the list we will run through the function.  The second and third parameters, `start`and `end`, are to indicate which row to start with and which row to end with (please note the `end` value is the number after the last row you want).  The last parameter, `rows_and_columns`, is assigned as `False`, to indicate the assumption that there are no rows and columns.  
<br>
Inside the `explore data()` function, there are three activities happening: 1) a new variable is assigned using the indicated parameters, 2) a for-loop statement, and 3) a conditional statement.  The variable, `dataset_slice`, is using the parameters: `dataset`, `start`, and `end`, to create the range of rows.  The for-loop uses `data_slice` to print each row determined by the `start` and `end` value, with a space in between each row. The conditional statement shows that if the parameter, `rows_and_columns`, is "True", then to find and print the number of rows and columns.
<br>


```python
def explore_data(dataset, start, end, rows_and_columns=False):
    dataset_slice = dataset[start:end]    
    for row in dataset_slice:
        print(row)
        print('\n') # adds a new (empty) line after each row

    if rows_and_columns:
        print('Number of rows:', len(dataset))
        print('Number of columns:', len(dataset[0]))
```

Below, the header and data rows 1 through 4 are printed for the ios apps.  The `rows_and_columns` were assigned "True", in order to count the number of columns and rows.



```python
print(ios_header)
print('\n')

explore_data(ios_data, 0, 5, rows_and_columns=True)

# Removing Duplicate Entries
<br>

###  Part 1 (Finding Duplicate Rows)

In the dataset, we can see there are duplicate entries for the same apps.  Below is an example of duplicate entries from the Android dataset.


```python
print(android_header)
for app in app_data_android:
    name = app[0]
    if name == "Instagram":
        print(app)
```

    ['App', 'Category', 'Rating', 'Reviews', 'Size', 'Installs', 'Type', 'Price', 'Content Rating', 'Genres', 'Last Updated', 'Current Ver', 'Android Ver']
    ['Instagram', 'SOCIAL', '4.5', '66577313', 'Varies with device', '1,000,000,000+', 'Free', '0', 'Teen', 'Social', 'July 31, 2018', 'Varies with device', 'Varies with device']
    ['Instagram', 'SOCIAL', '4.5', '66577446', 'Varies with device', '1,000,000,000+', 'Free', '0', 'Teen', 'Social', 'July 31, 2018', 'Varies with device', 'Varies with device']
    ['Instagram', 'SOCIAL', '4.5', '66577313', 'Varies with device', '1,000,000,000+', 'Free', '0', 'Teen', 'Social', 'July 31, 2018', 'Varies with device', 'Varies with device']
    ['Instagram', 'SOCIAL', '4.5', '66509917', 'Varies with device', '1,000,000,000+', 'Free', '0', 'Teen', 'Social', 'July 31, 2018', 'Varies with device', 'Varies with device']


Above, we see there are four entries for the Instagram app.  The fourth item in each row, shows the number of reviews that have taken place for the Instagram app.  Later on, we are going to keep the row with the highest review and then delete the rest.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Below, a for-loop is created to collect all duplicates.  The `duplicate_apps[]` and `unique_apps[]` are initially created as empty lists.  A for-loop is created to append to the list of either the duplicate or unique app.  Each row of data goes through the for-loop and the app-name is initially added to the `unique_app[]` list if it is the first time.  In the for-loop, if a name is already identified as being in the `unique_apps[]` list, then any additional data that has the same app-name is added to the `duplicate_apps[]` list.  Lastly, there is a print text on the number of duplicates and an example of the first 15 duplicated names.


```python
duplicate_apps_android = []
unique_apps_android = []

for app in app_data_android:
    name = app[0]
    if name in unique_apps_android:
        duplicate_apps_android.append(name)
    else:
        unique_apps_android.append(name)
    
print('Number of duplicate apps:', len(duplicate_apps_android))
print('\n')
print('Examples of duplicate apps:', duplicate_apps_android[:15])
```

    Number of duplicate apps: 1181
    
    
    Examples of duplicate apps: ['Quick PDF Scanner + OCR FREE', 'Box', 'Google My Business', 'ZOOM Cloud Meetings', 'join.me - Simple Meetings', 'Box', 'Zenefits', 'Google Ads', 'Google My Business', 'Slack', 'FreshBooks Classic', 'Insightly CRM', 'QuickBooks Accounting: Invoicing & Expenses', 'HipChat - Chat Built for Teams', 'Xero Accounting Software']


Based on the results from above, we can see that there are 1,181 duplicate names.  In the example, we can see that the app name, "Box", is shown atleast two times.  
<br>
<br>


  

### Part 2 (Using a Dictionary)
<br>
Below, we created a dictionary to retain all apps with their highest number of reviews (and no duplicates).  To start, we created an empty dictionary called `review_max`.  A for-loop is created to go through each record for the Android dataset.  Initially, all app-names will be deposited into the `review_max` because they did not exist there before. Afterwards, if the app-name is found in `review_max` dictionary and if the number of reviews for the app (in the dictionary) is less than the number of reviews being presented in the iteration, then the higher value of number of reviews is updated into the dictionary.  


```python
review_max = {}
for app_name in android_data:
    name = app_name[0]
    n_reviews = float(app_name[3])
    if name in review_max and review_max[name] < n_reviews:
        review_max[name] = n_reviews
    elif name is not review_max:
        review_max[name] = n_reviews
```

To confirm the number of unique apps in our dataset, we print the number of apps expected versus the number of apps that actually exist in the dictionary.  The number of apps expected is an arithmetic operation.


```python
print('Expected length after deleting duplicates: ', len(android_data) - len(duplicate_apps_android))
print("Acual length: ", len(review_max))
```

    Expected length after deleting duplicates:  9659
    Acual length:  9659


Above, we see that the numbers match.  Our expected number of records we have is 9,659 records and the actual number of records in our dictionary is 9,659.
<br>
<br>
Below, we seperate the records to only have the unique apps into a list labelled, `android_clean[]`.  To do this, we create a for-loop that will iterate through the `android_data` dataset. An if-statement is created so that Python can iterate the dataset to determine if the `n_reviews` value is the same as the value listed in the maximum review dictionary.  If so, and if the app `name` does not already exist in the `already_listed` list, then the app record is appended to the `android_clean` list and to the `already_added` list.  The `already_added` list serves as a way to block any duplicates from getting into the `android_clean` list.  


```python
android_clean = []
already_added = []

for app_name in android_data:
    name = app_name[0]
    n_reviews = float(app_name[3])
    if n_reviews == review_max[name] and name not in already_added:
        android_clean.append(app_name)
        already_added.append(name)
```

<br>
<br>

Below, we explore the `android_clean` list by using the `explore_data`function that was created before.


```python
explore_data(android_clean, 0, 5, rows_and_columns=True)
```

    ['Photo Editor & Candy Camera & Grid & ScrapBook', 'ART_AND_DESIGN', '4.1', '159', '19M', '10,000+', 'Free', '0', 'Everyone', 'Art & Design', 'January 7, 2018', '1.0.0', '4.0.3 and up']
    
    
    ['U Launcher Lite â€“ FREE Live Cool Themes, Hide Apps', 'ART_AND_DESIGN', '4.7', '87510', '8.7M', '5,000,000+', 'Free', '0', 'Everyone', 'Art & Design', 'August 1, 2018', '1.2.4', '4.0.3 and up']
    
    
    ['Sketch - Draw & Paint', 'ART_AND_DESIGN', '4.5', '215644', '25M', '50,000,000+', 'Free', '0', 'Teen', 'Art & Design', 'June 8, 2018', 'Varies with device', '4.2 and up']
    
    
    ['Pixel Draw - Number Art Coloring Book', 'ART_AND_DESIGN', '4.3', '967', '2.8M', '100,000+', 'Free', '0', 'Everyone', 'Art & Design;Creativity', 'June 20, 2018', '1.1', '4.4 and up']
    
    
    ['Paper flowers instructions', 'ART_AND_DESIGN', '4.4', '167', '5.6M', '50,000+', 'Free', '0', 'Everyone', 'Art & Design', 'March 26, 2017', '1.0', '2.3 and up']
    
    
    Number of rows: 9659
    Number of columns: 13


We can see that the number of rows, 9,659, from the `explore_data` function matches our expectations of how many rows we should have.
